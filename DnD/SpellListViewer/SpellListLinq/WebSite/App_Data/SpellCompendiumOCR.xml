      <p>The weapon you hold in your hand begins to fade from existence as you complete the spell. With the last words of the spell it disappears completely. At the same moment, a weapon-shaped red blotch appears on your arm.</p>
      <p>You can harmlessly absorb a weapon you are touching (even a poisoned one) into your arm, as long as it is not in another creature’s possession. The weapon must be a light weapon for you at the time you cast the spell. The absorbed weapon cannot be felt under the skin and doesn’t restrict your range of motion in any way. An absorbed weapon cannot be detected with even a careful search, although detect magic reveals the presence of a magical aura.</p>
      <p>The only evidence of its presence is a faint blotch on your skin shaped vaguely like the weapon.</p>
      <p>When you touch the spot (an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), or when the spell duration expires, the weapon appears in your hand and the spell ends. If you attack with the weapon in the same round that you retrieve it from its hiding place, you can attempt a Bluff check to feint in combat as a free action, and you gain a +4 bonus on the Bluff check. An intelligent magic weapon gets a saving throw against this spell, but other weapons do not.</p>

      <p>As you complete the spell’s intricate gestures, you detect as light buzz at the edge of your hearing. Your body feels warmer, and a feeling of security fills you.</p>
      <p>Spells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own. Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target. Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed.</p>
      <p>Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected.</p>
      <p>For example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th level spell. Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you’re struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell.</p>
      <p>You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don’t disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.</p>

      <p>The spell copies only non magical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spell book, a spell scroll, or a sepia snake sigil).

      <p>If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell’s duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages.</p>
      <p>The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy.</p>

Analyze portal does not allow other divination spells or spell-like abilities to extend through the portal. For example, you cannot also use detect magic or detect evil to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with analyze portal.</p>
      <p>For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20+ caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round.</p>
      <p>Analyze portal has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows.</p>
      <p>•  Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.</p>
      <p>•  Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal’s destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.</p>
      <p>•  Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal’s destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.</p>
      <p>Gaining the benefits of the amorphous body spell can be disconcerting</p>

When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The Animate breath gives a lone dragon a powerful ally animated breath then attacks whom-ANIMATE FIRE ever or whatever you designate. The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) damage. The animated breath uses the statistics of a Huge fire elemental (MM 99), with the following exceptions. •  The creature’s subtype changes to match the energy damage dealt by the breath weapon. •  The creature deals 2d8 points of damage of the same type as the breath weapon with each successful slam attack, instead of 2d8 points of fire. •  The creature has immunity to its own energy type, but no vulnerability to another energy type. •  The creature does not have the burn ability.

      <p>The arcane words that activate this spell linger in the air for a moment. As they fade from your hearing, you become more aware of both your surroundings and the possibility of intrusion.</p>
      <p>The subject of the spell is surrounded with an invisible aura that anticipates and delays the teleportation of any creature into the spell’s area. Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell’s recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature’s size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay.</p>
      <p>Since a teleporting creature doesn’t necessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destination was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell’s area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn’t give any awareness as to the actual location of its imminent arrival.</p>
      <p>The spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell’s area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal.</p>

      <p>With the casting of this spell you are surrounded with acool, blue mist that clings to your body, dampening the heat of the nearby flames.</p>
      <p>You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 10 points of fire damage as a resist energy (fire) spell (PH 272). In addition to the resist energy (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.</p>
      <p>Any non magical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame’s maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist’s fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.</p>
      <p>You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it (use the caster level of aura against flame for the caster level check). If you succeed, you take no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your aura against flame), and both spells remain.</p>
      <p>With a readied action, you can use the aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check, or if the attack is not a fire attack, the aura remains.</p>

      <p>You shoot a black ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing your foe to violently purge blood vessels through its skin. The purged blood vessels spread outward, creating a many-layered mass of bloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearby creatures in a gory horror.</p>
      <p>You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.</p>
      <p>If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell.</p>
      <p>The avascular mass instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points—such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls—or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius avascular mass become entangled. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled. Because the avascular mass is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell.</p>
      <p>Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the avascular mass and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck.</p>
      <p>A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25</p>
      <p>Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape</p>
      <p>Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.</p>
      <p>If you have at least 5 feet of avascular mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of avascular mass between you, it provides total cover.</p>
      <p>The avascular mass of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue.</p>

      <p>The danger of the plane surprises you, and you have barely time to bark out a few elder words of power. In a moment you’re safe, and you gain a brief respite—time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.</p>
      <p>You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane.</p>
      <p>These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (DMG 150).</p>
      <p>Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can’t be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character’s full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don’t deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.</p>
      <p>In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects.</p>
      <p>In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of</p>
      <p>Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The</p>
      <p>DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.</p>
      <p>The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren’t negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).</p>
      <p>The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won’t protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.</p>

      <p>This spell awakens a humanoid-shaped construct to humanlike sentience. An awakened construct’s Intelligence,</p>
      <p>Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all 3d6. The spell does not work on constructs that are constructs only temporarily (such as objects affected by an animate objects spell).

      <p>Undead also regain any extra or di nary racial abilities they had in life, such as poison or scent.</p>
      <p>Awakened undead gain a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist control undead. Awakened undead also gain +2 turn resistance (or retain their own turn resistance, if any, and if it is better than +2).</p>

      <p>This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with the order of law, turning it into axiomatic water. Axiomatic water damages lawful outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of axiomatic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pout the axiomatic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with axiomatic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p>A direct hit by a flask of axiomatic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a chaotic outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>

      <p>With a circuitous pass of your hand through the air, a crackling ball of lightning appears before you, accompanied by the smell of ozone.</p>
      <p>You create a 5-foot-diameter ball of concentrated electricity that rolls in whichever direction you point, dealing electricity damage to creatures it strikes.</p>
      <p>It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a subject. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), though a successful</p>
      <p>Reflex save negates that damage.</p>
      <p>The ball moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you), otherwise it merely stays at rest, damaging any creature in its space. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The lightning winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.</p>

      <p>A bogun is a small nature servant created by a druid. Like a homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing the same alignment and link to nature. A bogun does not fight particularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such as attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window. For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its creator’s instructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable. On rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun might refuse to perform a particular task. In that case, the creator must make a DC 11 Diplomacy check to convince the creature to cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task as requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours (DM’s option as to which).</p>
      <p>A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards. A bogun never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.</p>
      <p>In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact with its creator. An attack that destroys a bogun also deals its creator 2d10 points of damage. If its creator is slain, a bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.</p>
      <p>A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost.</p>
      <p>The creator determines its precise features, but a typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about 2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.</p>
      <p>Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponents with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.</p>
      <p>Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural materials available in any forest. Thus, there is no gold piece cost for its creation. All materials used become permanent parts of the bogun.</p>
      <p>The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft</p>
      <p>Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting any spells, the creator must weave a physical form out of living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy.</p>
      <p>A bit of the creator’s own body, such as a few strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude mannequin. The creator can assemble the body personally or hire someone else to do it. Creating this mannequin requires a DC 12 Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check.</p>
      <p>Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creature’s body, that process and the ritual can be performed together.</p>
      <p>When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started a new, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.</p>
      <p>On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers. wraps itself around your hand, turning it into smoke as well.</p>
      <p>With a successful touch attack, you deal 2d12 points of damage. For every three caster levels, the smoke lasts for another round (to a maximum of 4 additional rounds at 12th level), dealing another 2d12 points of damage per round.</p>
      <p>Material Component: A small vial of smoke.</p>

      <p>The blade always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends. You can direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action.</p>
      <p>A gate spell can be used to counterspell a black blade of disaster. A dimensional anchor spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation can affect it. Its touch attack AC is 13.</p>

The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but antimagic field, a successful dispel magic, remove curse, or break enchantment snuffs it out.</p>

      <p>You can cast this spell only at the beginning of your turn, before you take any other actions. After casting blade storm, you can take a full-round action to make one attack with each melee weapon you are currently wielding against every foe within reach. If you wield more than one weapon, or a double weapon, you can attack each foe once with each weapon or end, using the normal rules for two-weapon fighting (PH 160). So, a ranger wielding a longsword and a short sword could attack each opponent he can reach with both weapons.

You can also make a regular melee attack (or offhand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. If a creature initiates a grapple with you, it takes the same damage, and you gain a bonus on grapple checks to resist the grapple equal to the damage dealt.

Your mind set changes so that you relish combat and cannot cast spells, even from magic items. You gain the Strength and Dexterity of an average warforged titan (Str 28, Dex 8), but you retain your own mental ability scores. You have no Constitution score while affected by this spell.

You cannot speak or cast spells while in warforged titan form.</p>
      <p>Your natural armor bonus becomes +18, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form, and you gain damage reduction 10/adamantine.</p>
      <p>As a construct, you have the following qualities: immunity to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, and to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). You also gain the warforged titan’s two attack forms (axe and maul), along with the trample special ability (damage 1d8+13; Reflex</p>
      <p>DC 25 half). The warforged titan’s axe deals 2d8 points of slashing damage and has a ×3 critical modifier; its maul (essentially a huge war hammer) deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage and also has a ×3 critical modifier.

Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider to fall through the horse’s smoky form; he or she cannot thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand.

      <p>The smoke horse has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet.

      <p>The rider can return the smoke horse to the bottle, and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stoppering it again (another move action) in the next round after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later, the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceases functioning 24 hours after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is corked, the spell ends.</p>

      <p>For the duration of the spell, as a standard action, you can eavesdrop on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired:</p>
      <p>•  A creature’s surface thoughts.</p>
      <p>•  Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.</p>
      <p>•  One nugget of information per caster level from all the minds regarding one particular topic, thing, or being.</p>
      <p>•  The thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.</p>
      <p>Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature’s mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a suggestion (PH 285) in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the suggestion, using the original save DC. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the suggestion.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider for that creature.</p>

      <p>The taste of copper fills your mouth and bloody spatters punctuate the last few words that unlock the spell. You gags lightly as the blood in your mouth congeals, but disappears even as you release the spell.</p>
      <p>You taint a living creature’s blood with a hot, corrosive infusion, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage and 1d8 points of fire damage per round. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage, but a successful save does not prevent damage in future rounds. Searing pain limits the subject to a single move action in any round when it fails its Fortitude save.</p>
      <p>Burning blood does not affect creatures of the construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead types.</p>

      <p>A caltrops spell covers one 5-foot-by-5 foot square with caltrops. Every time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target’s shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.</p>
      <p>A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one-half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15</p>
      <p>Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it stepson a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>
      <p>The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.</p>
      <p>For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-foot by-5-foot square, and the caltrops’ attack bonus increases by 1.

After the missiles strike, they ricochet to a number of targets up to the number of missiles created by the spell. Each secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of damage, as if struck by a single magic missile. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no secondary target can be struck more than once.

      <p>The climb walls spell helps make treacherous ascents simple work</p>
      <p>When you cast this spell, your hands become shadowy claws. Starting on your next action, you can use the claws to make unarmed attacks as if they were natural weapons. (You attack with one claw and can use the other claw for an off-hand attack. If you have multiple attacks, you use them normally when attacking with the claws.) Attacks with the claws are melee touch attacks. Each claw deals 1d8 points of cold damage. If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effect of a slow spell for as long as you maintain the grapple. An opponent that makes a successful Fortitude save is not slowed, and it cannot be slowed by this casting of claws of darkness.</p>
      <p>You can extend the claws up to 6 feet, which gives you a natural reach of 10 feet, or retract them as a free action.</p>
      <p>When the spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with components other than verbal ones, nor can you carry items with your hands. Any magic items worn on your hands are temporarily absorbed and cease functioning while the spell is active.</p>

      <p>A few words and motions, and the swirling color pool becomes as silver-gray as the rest of the Astral Plane.</p>
      <p>This spell causes a color pool on the</p>
      <p>Astral Plane (DMG 154)—an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane—to seemingly cease to exist. In truth, the color pool is only hidden from view. The use of this spell does not hide the area around the pool; it masks only the fact that a pool is present. See invisibility or true seeing reveals the presence of the pool, as does analyze portal.</p>

      <p>This spell functions like fog cloud (PH 232), except as noted here. Each round that a creature is within the fog, it must make a Fortitude save or contract a disease equivalent to the shakes (DMG 292), which strikes immediately (no incubation period). A creature afflicted with this disease takes 1d8 points of Dexterity damage immediately, and each day that the disease persists, it must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take another 1d8 points of Dexterity damage.</p>
      <p>The fog moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground or water. (Figure out the cloud’s new spread each round based on its new center, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.) Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the surface over which they move, pouring down sinkhole openings, and even down through minute cracks. Contagious fog cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.</p>

      <p>This spell functions similarly to contingency (PH 213), but with a more limiteds cope. While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for up to 10 minutes per caster level, or until the remainder of the spell’s duration, just as if you were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appropriate type.</p>
      <p>Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can’t be changed.</p>
      <p>You can’t have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect on yourself at the same time—if you cast the spell a second time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires.</p>
      <p>The energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type (such as from the resist energy spell).</p>
      <p>However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy (fire) and contingent energy resistance (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy.</p>

      <p>You finish the last detail and lean back to look at your work. The tattoo looks good. It should prove useful.</p>
      <p>This spell creates a single magic tattoo.</p>
      <p>You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo—at least 1 rank of Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligraphy), or a similar Craft skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful Craft check.</p>
      <p>The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below.</p>
      <p>If you are a 3rd-to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects (Craft</p>
      <p>DC 10).</p>
      <p>•  +2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or</p>
      <p>Will).</p>
      <p>•  +1 luck bonus on attack rolls.</p>
      <p>•  +1 deflection bonus to AC.</p>
      <p>At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe (Craft DC 15).</p>
      <p>•  +2 resistance bonus on saving throws.</p>
      <p>•  +2 competence bonus on attack rolls.</p>
      <p>When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe (Craft</p>
      <p>DC 20).</p>
      <p>•  Spell resistance equal to 10+1 per three caster levels.</p>
      <p>•  +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score.</p>
      <p>•  +1 spell caster level. This effect increases the subject’s effective level, but not the total number of spells.</p>
      <p>For example, an 11th-level caster who receives this tattoo functions as a 12th-level caster for the purpose of determining level-based spell variables (such as range, area, effect, and so on), but he does not receive any extra spells.</p>
      <p>A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails.</p>
      <p>A successful erase spell removes a single magic tattoo. A successful dispel magic spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing them.</p>
      <p>Material Components: Tattoo inks in appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp.</p>
      <p>Focus: Tattoo needles.</p>

You can hurl one bolt for every two caster levels you have (maximum seven bolts). You can hurl all the bolts at once, or you can hurl one bolt per round as a free action, starting in the round when you cast the spell. You do not have to hurl a bolt in every round, but if you don’t hurl the bolt you were entitled to in a round, it is lost. If you hurl all the bolts at once, all your targets must be within 60 feet of each other.</p>
      <p>A dark bolt deals 2d8 points of damage to a living creature, and the creature is dazed for 1 round unless it makes a</p>
      <p>Will save (a creature struck by multiple bolts during the same round is dazed for a maximum of 1 round, no matter how many times it fails its save). An undead creature takes no damage, but is dazed if it fails its save.</p>

      <p>From your outstretched hand bursts a small sphere similar in appearance to a soap bubble. It quickly expands and speeds in the direction you indicate.</p>
      <p>A globe of supernaturally dry air rolls in whichever direction you point and engulfs those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round and can leap up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d4 points of damage as it evaporates moisture from the subject. (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.) Oozes, creatures composed of water (such as water elementals), and creatures with the aquatic subtype take 2d6 points of damage.</p>
      <p>The bubble moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest.</p>
      <p>The surface of the bubble has a spongy, yielding consistency (similar to that of a soap bubble, but not fragile and allowing objects to pass through it without affecting the spell) and so does not cause damage except by absorbing moisture. It cannot batter down large obstacles. The bubble winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.</p>

A wizard who knows alter self is not a shape changer (since a spell is not a supernatural or extraordinary ability), but a barghest is (since it has the supernatural ability to assume alternate forms, even though its type is outsider).</p>

      <p>You make one undead—including its clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature’s body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature.</p>
      <p>The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form.</p>
      <p>It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the undead or its equipment. A bat tleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe.</p>
      <p>This spell also foils magical means of detecting undead. The subject of disguise undead detects as a creature of the type simulated.</p>
      <p>Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with the subject (such as by touching the undead and having that not match what they see, in the case of this spell).</p>

      <p>You exhale acloud of poisonous gas mixed with starlight motes that gravitate toward the spell casters and summoned monsters within the cloud.</p>
      <p>For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a super natural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73).</p>
      <p>When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon acts as a targeted dispel magic (PH 223).</p>
      <p>For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the highest level spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20+1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11+ the spell’s caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks. A creature’s magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected.</p>
      <p>If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came).</p>
      <p>For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>
      <p>Spells are dispelled prior to the effect of your breath weapon being resolved.</p>

      <p>Any spell effect operating on a creature or unattended object that passes through the screen is affected as by a targeted dispel magic (PH 223) at your caster level. Attended items that pass through are not affected by the screen, which is the only way the screen differs from a normal targeted casting of dispel magic—attended items are essentially not targeted by the screen. Make a caster level check (1d20+1 per caster level, maximum +10) to dispel spell effects (DC 11+ caster level) or suppress an unattended object’s magical properties for 1d4 rounds (DC equal to the item’s caster level). Spell effects not operating on objects or creatures cannot pass through the screen. A disintegrate or successful dispel magic removes dispelling screen, while an antimagic field suppresses it.</p>

      <p>This payment must be made before the dragon agrees to perform any services.</p>
      <p>The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p>
      <p>Tasks requiring up to 1 minute per caster level require a payment of 50 gp per HD of the called dragon. For a task requiring up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 250 gp per HD. Long-term tasks (those requiring up to 1 day per caster level) require a payment of 500 gp per HD.</p>
      <p>Especially hazardous tasks require a greater gift, up to twice the given amount. A dragon never accepts less than the indicated amount, even for a nonhazardous task.</p>
      <p>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for elapses, the creature returns to the place it was called from (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p>

      <p>This spell functions like dream (PH 225), except as noted above and that you can alter the sleeping person’s dreams to produce a specific desired effect.

      <p>You scribe a spiral in the air with the diamond-tipped bit of charcoal, chanting the words of the spell. Immediately the sides of the cavern begin to contract, sealing the passage behind you.</p>
      <p>You cause a 1-foot length of subterranean tunnel to constrict, “locking” it against others who might wish to traverse its length. This spell affects only naturally occurring tunnels or worked tunnels that are surrounded on all sides by unworked, natural, subterranean earth. You can affect any tunnel whose diameter does not exceed 10 feet.</p>
      <p>Asquare-sided or rough tunnel can also be affected, as long as its diameter at the point where the spell is cast does not exceed 10 feet.</p>
      <p>An earth lock spell causes a tunnel to constrict seconds before charging minotaurs reach the gap</p>
      <p>The constriction takes 1 round to complete. Any Large or smaller object or creature that partially blocks the constriction point is pushed, unharmed, to one side or the other. (A creature can decide whichway to move; an object moves randomly.) A Large or larger object or creature that blocks the constriction point prevents the spell from working until moved.</p>
      <p>You can freely pass through tunnels that you have secured with this spell. (The constriction opens and closes on your command, taking 1 round for either process). A tunnel secured with earth lock can be bypassed by others in several ways. A DC 20 Escape Artist check allows the creature making the check to squeeze through the constriction but leaves it intact.</p>
      <p>A DC 25 Strength check breaks the constriction and ends the spell. A successful dispel magic or knock spell opens the constriction—the former by ending the spell and the latter by suppressing it for 10 minutes. If a creature burrows through the earth lock, the spell ends. The constricted tunnel can also be dug out normally.</p>
      <p>Identifying a tunnel secured with earth lock (as opposed to a tunnel that just ends) requires a DC 20 Search check.</p>

      <p>You grant the subject an affinity for earth and stone. Any damage the subject takes from a stone or earthen source counts as nonlethal damage for the duration of the spell.

Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the arm can target multiple creatures, you choose one.

      <p>Completing the powerful spell, you bring into being floating spheres of silver, like bubbles of mercury.</p>
      <p>When you cast this spell, you bring forth one floating, silvery sphere per caster level, each about the size of your head. These spheres hover around you to provide protection from magical effects. As a standard action, you can shift the spell’s effect (and thus all the spheres) to any other creature within range. You can shift the effect once per round.</p>
      <p>Each of these spheres can absorb and completely negate any spell or spell-like ability, regardless of level, that directly targets the subject. The spheres do not automatically absorb all spells; the subject can choose whether or not to let them absorb any given spell cast upon it. (This option allows the creature to benefit from helpful spells.) Area spells and spells that do not actually have a target cannot be absorbed. Once a sphere has absorbed a spell or spell-like ability, its imply fades away. Only spells and spell-like abilities of deific power can overcome the protection provided by effulgent epuration.</p>

      <p>You gain the following abilities when you cast elemental body:</p>
      <p>•  You have the benefits of the attune form spell (page 17) with respect to the appropriate element. If you choose a water body, for example, you can breathe normally on water dominant planes.</p>
      <p>•  You are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning, and are not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. You gain dark vision out to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>•  Your creature type remains unchanged, so you are unaffected by spells that target elementals, but you gain the air, earth, fire, or water subtype depending on the elemental substance you chose.</p>
      <p>In addition, you gain the following exceptional abilities according to the element chosen:</p>
      <p>Air: Fly at your normal speed (perfect maneuverability), air mastery (airborne creatures take a–1 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls against you).</p>
      <p>Earth: Earth mastery (you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both you and your foe touch the ground), push (you can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity), +3 natural armor bonus to AC.</p>
      <p>Fire: Fire immunity, burn (those you hit in melee and those who attack you with natural weapons must make a Reflex save or catch fire, with a save</p>
      <p>DC equal to that of a fire elemental of the same size).</p>
      <p>Water: Swim at your normal speed, water mastery (you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both you and your opponent touch water), drench (you can use your elemental form to put out non magical open flames and dispel magi cal fire you touch as if casting dispel magic at your caster level).</p>
      <p>The elemental body spell has the desc rip tor of the element you choose. So, if you choose a body of fire, elemental body is a fire spell.</p>

      <p>This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete immunity to damage from one of the five energy types—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Energy immunity absorbs only hit point damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drowning in acid, being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice (and thus helpless).</p>
      <p>Energy immunity overlaps protection from energy and resist energy. As long as energy immunity is in effect, the other spells absorb no damage.</p>

      <p>You create a circle of five colored spheres that orbit your head at a distance of 1 foot. These spheres provide as much light as a torch and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic).</p>
      <p>If used to attack, on your turn as a standard action you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere deals 5 points of energy damage per five caster levels (maximum 20 points of damage) to a single creature, so an 11th-level caster’s sphere deals 10 points of energy damage. The subject can make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere.</p>
      <p>If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage. Each sphere grants you energy resistance 5 per five caster levels. If a sphere is used to absorb damage, that sphere is destroyed.</p>

      <p>You hold the eye in your palm, sprinkle it with blood and diamonds, and speak the words. Slowly it rises from your hand, emitting a soft beam that illuminates the chosen area. Then it disappears, and you place the spell within the magic trap.</p>
      <p>You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an energy transformation field tied to a summon monster V spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.</p>
      <p>The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast fireball spell or a charge from a wand of fireball would add three spell levels to the field’s store, a potion of cure light wounds would add one, and a wish from a ring of three wishes would add nine. Items that don’t have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an immovable rod would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its levitate prerequisite).</p>
      <p>Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.</p>
      <p>The field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a continual flame would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.</p>
      <p>An energy transformation field has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the dura tion of its previous casting has expired.</p>
      <p>If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field’s concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction).</p>
      <p>Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.</p>
      <p>Typical spells linked to an energy transformation field are blindness/deafness, fireball, suggestion, summon monster, or wall of force. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment).</p>
      <p>Only Mordenkainen’s disjunction, limited wish, wish, or similar spells can destroy the energy transformation field.</p>
      <p>Spells of lower level, such as dispel magic and greater dispel magic, are absorbed by it, and an antimagic field prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area.</p>

      <p>For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73).</p>
      <p>When you successfully cast this spell, you can modify your breath weapon so that it is laced with negative energy. In addition to the normal energy damage your breath weapon deals, creatures that fail their saving throws against the breath weapon gain 2d4 negative levels.</p>
      <p>If the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies.</p>
      <p>Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties:–1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).

      <p>You enchant a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled to give you what it is holding when you cast this spell. On the creature’s next action, it moves as close to you as it can get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard action. This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept the “gift” if the creature reaches you to handy out he object (assuming you have a free hand and can accept it). The subject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired. If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell has no effect. For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.</p>

      <p>A cocoon of force encloses a crea ture of size Large or smaller, containing it for the spell’s duration or until the co coon is destroyed. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 10 hit points per caster level. The envel oping cocoon prevents the creature trapped inside from moving or cast i ng spells with somatic components. The cocoon is too confining to permit effective attacks with any thing larger than a natural or light weapon (and the creature inside can attack only the cocoon in any event).</p>
      <p>You can attach a sec on d spell to the cocoon by casting it at the co coon. When the enveloping cocoon spell ends or is dismissed, the attached spell automatically affects the creature inside, with no save allowed (although spell resistance, if any, still applies). If the cocoon is destroyed before it is dismissed or the spell duration ends, the attached spell is wasted.</p>
      <p>Any of the following spells from this book can be attached to an enveloping cocoon: infestation of maggots, languor, miasma, and phantasmal disorientation. In addition, a cocoon can be used in conjunction with these spells from the Player’s Handbook: baleful polymorph, blight, contagion, dominate animal, flame strike, and poison (the subject fails the initial save but can attempt the second save).</p>

      <p>Your voice trails off into whispers as you near the end of the spell’s complex ritual.</p>
      <p>The whispers begin to build upon one another, echoing in the air around you, swirling and twisting until they become a steady cacophony. The wind gathers speed, creating a spherical vortex around you.</p>
      <p>With this spell, you create a swirling miniature storm that provides a measure of protection, but leaves you and those near you unaffected.</p>
      <p>The storm that surrounds you has hurricane-force winds spinning in a circle with you at the center.</p>
      <p>Normal ranged attacks through the hurricane’s windy area are impossible, and even heavier projectiles such assiege weapons and giant boul ders take a–8 penalty on the attack roll.</p>
      <p>Creatures who move inside the spell’s area suffer effects depending on their size and whether they’re airborne.</p>
      <p>Each creature must make a saving throw at the beginning of its turn or when it enters the affected area.</p>
      <p>Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4×10 feet away from the eye of the hurricane’s center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet traveled in this manner. Creatures blown away are knocked prone as well.</p>
      <p>Flying creatures are blown back 2d6×10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>
      <p>Large creatures must succeed on a</p>
      <p>Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6×10 feet.</p>
      <p>Huge creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be checked. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6×5 feet.</p>
      <p>Gargantuan and Colossal creatures can move through the spell’s area with out adverse consequences.</p>
      <p>Even creatures that succeed on their saving throws must attempt them again whenever they start a turn inside the spell’s area or whenever they move back into it.</p>
      <p>The spell’s area is effectively a sphere.</p>
      <p>Although the area is centered on you, you’re not within the wind. If you move, the eye of the hurricane moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast eye of the hurricane so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).</p>

      <p>Your invocation creates a miniature floating eye of faintly glowing blue energy. Spying your enemy from the safety of your magical sensor, you unleash your spell.</p>
      <p>This spell functions like arcane eye (PH 200), except as noted here. You can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower that has a range other than personal through the eye. Any spell so cast functions as though it had been cast from the eye’s location rather than yours. Casting any spell of higher than 3rd level through the eye not only produces no effect (though the spell is still expended), but it destroys the eye of power and ends the spell.</p>
      <p>Unlike an arcane eye, an eye of power is visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed. The eye is a Fine object with</p>
      <p>AC 18 and 77 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for saving throws.</p>

      <p>You summon four fiendish dire bats (MM 62) that blaze with a faint ghoul green light (they glow as bright as a candle). These fiendish dire bats have damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite good attack that provides a +4 bonus on one damage roll.</p>
      <p>The bats allow you to see through their eyes, from their perspective, using your own visual senses. If you have dark vision, low-light vision, or spells cast that enhance your visual senses, such as true seeing or see invisibility, you continue to gain the benefit of those abilities or spells through the eyes of your bat minions. The bats also give you the benefit of their blindsense ability for the purpose of viewing their surroundings for the duration of the spell.</p>
      <p>You can summon the bats at any point you can see, but they can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. Even while outside your line of sight, they follow your mental directions on where to explore. The dire bats travel together, never separating by more than 40 feet. They fly with a speed of 40 feet if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or at half speed (speed 20 feet) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The bats can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts.</p>
      <p>You must concentrate to control the dire bats. If you do not concentrate, the bats move to attack the closest active creature. Once concentration lapses, the spell ends 5 rounds later.</p>

      <p>When you cast this spell, a garment or container becomes a safe haven for a Tiny or smaller familiar. The spell turns the target pocket into a comfortable extra dimensional space (about 1 cubic foot). The familiar can fit inside the space without creating any noticeable bulge in the item. Whenever the familiar is touching you, you can whisk it inside the space as a free action by speaking a command word chosen by you when the spell is cast. If the familiar can speak, it can command itself inside. As a free action, you can call the familiar forth or it can leave the space on its own.</p>
      <p>Once inside, the familiar has total cover and total concealment, and as a free action, you or the familiar can further seal the space to make it airtight and waterproof. The air supply inside the sealed space lasts for 1 hour, but with the pocket unsealed, the familiar can remain inside indefinitely. The familiar cannot attack or cast spells from within the space, but can use supernatural or spell-like abilities as normal (provided they don’t require line of sight, which the pocket blocks). You continue to gain the special ability granted by your familiar. While inside the pocket, the familiar continues to benefit from the share spells ability as if it were adjacent to you.</p>
      <p>The spell ends if the familiar pocket is placed within or taken into another extra dimensional space (such as a portable hole). If your familiar is within the pocket when the spell duration expires or if the spell ends abnormally (as above), the familiar appears in your space unharmed.</p>

      <p>Your spell generates an illusory, many armed, noisy, massive mechanical construct of impressive appearance.</p>
      <p>This spell creates a bizarre, but useful, machine that you can command to perform any simple, physical task that can be described in twenty-five words or less. You can order the machine to perform the same task over and over, but you can’t change the task. You must specify the task when you cast the spell.</p>
      <p>The machine always acts on your turn</p>
      <p>Fangs of the vampire king turns a spell caster into a bloodsucking horror in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.)</p>
      <p>The machine functions as a Large animated object (MM 13). It trundles over the ground at a speed of 40 feet.</p>
      <p>It can swim or fly at a speed of 10 feet (clumsy). It has 22 hit points, AC 14 (–1 size, +5 natural), and hardness 10. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +1, Reflex +1, Will–4.</p>
      <p>The machine has a Strength of 16.</p>
      <p>A light load for the machine is up to 172 pounds; a medium load is 173–346 pounds; and a heavy load is 347–520 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded.</p>
      <p>The machine can lift a weight of up to 1, 040 pounds to a height of 15 feet.</p>
      <p>It can push or drag 2, 600 pounds. It can excavate 7, 000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5-by-5-foot space in 3 rounds). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate.</p>
      <p>The machine has an attack bonus of +5 and can make one slam attack each round that deals 1d8+4 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+12) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +3. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments. A thrown rock deals 2d6+4 points of damage.</p>

      <p>This spell functions like fantastic machine, but you can concentrate on controlling the machine’s every action or specify a simple program, such as to collect all the logs in an area and stack them in a neat pile, plow a field, drive piles, or the like. The machine can perform only fairly simple physical tasks. Directing the machine’s actions or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.)</p>
      <p>Except where noted below, the machine functions as a Large animated object (MM 13) constructed from adamantine. It trundles over the ground at a speed of 60 feet. It can swim or fly at a speed of 20 feet (poor). It has 16 HD, 88 hit points, AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural), and hardness 20. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +5, Reflex +5, and Will +0.</p>
      <p>The machine has a Strength of 22.</p>
      <p>A light load for the machine is up to 346 pounds, a medium load is 347–692 pounds, and a heavy load is 693–1, 040 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded.</p>
      <p>The machine can lift a weight of up to 2, 080 pounds to a height of 15 feet.</p>
      <p>It can push or drag 5, 200 pounds. It can excavate 20, 000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5-by-5-foot space in 1 round). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate.</p>
      <p>The machine makes slam attacks with an attack bonus of +17/+12 for 1d8+9 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+27) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +12/+7. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments.

      <p>The subject gains immunity to nonlethal damage, charm and compulsion effects, and attacks that function specifically by causing pain, such as the wrack spell (see page 243). It is further immune to effects that would cause it to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned. The subject remains conscious at–1 to–9 hit points and can take a single action each round while in that state, and does not lose hit points for acting. If any of the above conditions were in effect on the subject at the time of casting, they are suspended for the spell’s duration. (Thus, an unconscious subject becomes conscious and functional.)</p>
      <p>When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that have not expired in the interim (such as the fatigued condition, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to recover from) return. Effects that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when it ends.</p>

      <p>This spell creates shuriken formed of magical fire that you can throw as a normal ranged attack. You are automatically considered proficient with the fire shuriken, which have a range increment of 10 feet, threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19–20, and deal 3d6 points of fire damage each on a successful hit (although you and your possessions take no damage as the shuriken are thrown). Any additional damage dealt by the fire shuriken (including your Strength bonus and sneak attack damage) is also fire damage. The shuriken disappear when they hit, so they cannot set fire to combustibles or damage objects.</p>
      <p>You can create one fire shuriken per three caster levels, up to a maximum of six at 18th level.</p>

      <p>You draw arcane power into your body, wrapping your feet and legs with wisps of flame.</p>
      <p>You gain the ability to step into fires and move from one fire to another. The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered “fires” for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava.</p>
      <p>Once in a fire, you instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 ft. +40 ft./level) and can transport yourself to one of them.</p>
      <p>Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire’s location doesn’t offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don’t sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can’t support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.</p>
      <p>Fire stride provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.</p>

      <p>In a flash of light and a roar of fire, your arms become wings of flame.</p>
      <p>This spell transforms your arms into wings of brilliant fire. The flame does not damage you or any items you carry.</p>
      <p>Because your arms are transformed, you cannot hold items in your hands or cast spells that require somatic components, but rings, bracers, and other items worn on your arms when you cast the spell still function normally. The wings allow you to fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor), with good maneuverability. You can charge but not run while flying, and you cannot carry more than alight load aloft. Using a fire wings spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can take other actions normally.</p>
      <p>If the spell duration expires while you are aloft, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds, then fall the rest of the distance if you haven’t already landed. Because dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fire wings spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.</p>
      <p>If you are not flying, you can make up to two attacks each round with the fire wings as if they were natural weapons.</p>
      <p>A successful attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage.</p>
      <p>The wings can be extinguished (and the spell canceled) by a quench spell, immersion in water, or a wind of hurricane or greater force.</p>
      <p>Material Component: The feather of a bird, which you must burn when you cast the spell.</p>

You can make the slam attack as a natural secondary attack with the normal–5 penalty, or a–2 penalty if you have the Multi attack feat (MM 304), as part of a full attack action.

      <p>A moment later, a thin blue ray swirled with whitest reaks from your outstretched hand, leaving alight fog in the air where it passed.</p>
      <p>You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.</p>
      <p>A target struck takes 2d6 points of cold damage. A creature struck must succeed on a Reflex save or be encased in a 5-inch-thick sheath of ice and be immobilized (and thus helpless). A creature encased in ice takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round until freed.</p>
      <p>A target encased in ice is aware and breathes normally but cannot speak or move other than to attempt to escape by making a Strength check (see below). It can still execute purely mental actions, such as using a spell-like ability. A spell caster can cast a spell with no verbal or somatic component as long as the spell lacks a focus or material component, or the material component, focus, or divine focus is already in the spell caster’s hand.</p>
      <p>The ice blocks line of effect. A winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim but, because ice floats, the encased swimmer will rise to the surface and bob about.</p>
      <p>A DC 22 Strength check breaks the ice, freeing the encased creature. Creatures other than the target can also attack the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 15 hit points. When the duration of the spell expires, the ice melts and the encased creature is freed. Damage that would harm the creature must first deal enough damage to destroy the ice before the creature takes damage, and damage dealt to the ice is subtracted from damage that would be dealt to the creature.</p>

      <p>Laughing at death, you assume a ghostly form in which you can pass through walls.</p>
      <p>You assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost.</p>
      <p>You gain the incorporeal subtype for the duration of the spell, providing you with the following abilities and characteristics.</p>
      <p>You have no physical body while in this state. You can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities.</p>
      <p>You are immune to all non magical attack forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons).</p>
      <p>Nondamaging spell effects affect you normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (such as implosion) or they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (such as a web or wall of stone spell).</p>
      <p>Your attacks while in ghost form pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against you. Non magical attacks you make with a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any melee attack you make with a magic weapon against a corporeal target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks you make with a ghost touch weapon, which are made normally (no miss chance). Spells you cast while in ghost form affect corporeal targets normally, including spells that require you to make an attack roll (such as rays or melee touch spells).</p>
      <p>Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also incorporeal as long as it remains in your possession. An object that you relinquish loses its incorporeal quality (and you lose the ability to manipulate the object). If you use a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as it is fired and can affect a corporeal target normally (no miss chance). Magic items you possess work normally with respect to their effects on you or on another target.</p>
      <p>As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).</p>
      <p>You can enter or pass through solid objects while in ghost form, but you must remain adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so you cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to your current location, but enemies have total concealment from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
      <p>You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled.</p>
      <p>In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in ghost form and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
      <p>You move silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if you don’t wish to be while in ghost form. You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modifier applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you.</p>
      <p>You have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when you cannot see.</p>

      <p>With your best giant’s shout you rattlesome pebbles in your closed hand, completing the spell that will allow them to become boulders.</p>
      <p>You infuse a handful of stone pebbles with powerful transmutation magic.</p>
      <p>For the duration of the spell, you can hurl one pebble as an attack action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p>The instant the pebble leaves contact with your hand, its size and the force of your throw increase dramatically, as the pebble transforms into a boulder.</p>
      <p>The boulder has a range increment of 120 feet, and you must succeed on a ranged attack to strike a target with the boulder. If you hit the target, the boulder deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage + your Str modifier. You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level on attack rolls and damage rolls (maximum +10) with these boulders.</p>
      <p>If you drop a pebble or give it to another creature, the pebbles’ magic dissipates harmlessly.</p>

      <p>You give the subject an additional pair of arms. Each of its arms—new and old—ends in a clawed hand with fingers and an opposable thumb. The creature’s original arms (if any) are its primary arms, and new limbs are secondary limbs (if the subject had no arms, the arms created by the spell are its primary arms).</p>
      <p>The creature gains four claw attacks, each using its base attack bonus + its Str modifier for attack rolls. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage + the subject’s Str modifier, and if an opponent is struck by two or more claws in 1 round, the subject can rend it for an additional 2d4 points of damage +1-1/2 times its Str modifier.</p>
      <p>A creature cannot use normal weapons and the claw attacks in the same round, and the subject does not gain additional claw attacks from a high base attack bonus.</p>

      <p>You concentrate on the tooth, speak the words, and a 15-foot-long tentacle sprouts from your stomach. The tentacle has no eyes, but it ends in a set of snapping reptilian jaws.</p>
      <p>The tentacle created by the gutsnake spell is equivalent to a giant constrictor snake (MM 280) except that it is completely obedient to you and moves as you command. The snake has hit points equal to your own full normal total. Attacks against the snake cause you no discomfort and do not disrupt your spellcasting.</p>
      <p>If it is “killed,” the tentacle disappears without causing harm to you. The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way.</p>
      <p>Once each round as a free action, you can have the tentacle attack a creature up to 10 feet away with its bite attack, and if it successfully hits, the tentacle can use the snake’s improved grab ability to deal damage through constriction.</p>
      <p>In each round when the gutsnake is constricting a target, you cannot move more than 5 feet away from that target, unless the gutsnake makes a successful grapple check to carry the opponent with you when you move (see PH 155 for grappling rules). This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement.</p>
      <p>While the snake is present, you can use its Balance and Climb skill modifiers instead of your own, and you gain a climb speed of 20 feet.</p>
      <p>Focus: A fang from any reptile.</p>

      <p>This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material’s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have hardness 16 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword’s hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A hardening spell does not in any way affect a substance’s resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on.</p>

      <p>This spell functions like Leo mund’s secure shelter (PH 247), except as noted here. The house created by hidden lodge is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It might appear as a house-sized boulder in a rocky or mountainous area, as a sand dune in the desert, as a densely tangled thicket, a grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The lodge also obscures all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within.</p>
      <p>At any distance of more than 30 feet, the lodge is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 30 feet is entitled to a DC 30 Survival check to spot the hidden lodge as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape.</p>

      <p>Days: You sense the events of the past, stretching back one day per caster level. You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired.</p>

      <p>Centuries: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st.</p>
      <p>For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries.</p>

      <p>Spell Turning: A holy star can turn a total of four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels, as the spell turning spell (PH 282). Any turning potential depleted through this use remains so for the duration of the spell; the holy star does not return to full capacity every time you choose this function. If its entire spell turning capacity is expended, this function no longer works, but the others do.</p>
      <p>Protection: A holy star gives you a +6 circumstance bonus to AC.</p>
      <p>Fire Bolt: A holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature (you choose the target) up to 90 feet away (no range increment). This attack uses your attack bonus and deals fire damage equal to 1d6 points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6).</p>

The chain attacks by attempting to trip your foes (+12 melee touch attack, +15 on the opposed Strength check). It does not provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping, nor can it be tripped in response on a failed attempt. If it succeeds in tripping an enemy, it immediately follows up with a melee attack on the prone defender (+12 melee attack, 2d6+10 points of damage). Any creature struck by the chain must make a Will saving throw or become shaken.</p>

      <p>A Large bulbous, fleshy mass seethes into being around a single Medium or smaller target within range. The target can make a Reflex save to avoid becoming engulfed by the hungry gizzard, otherwise it is entombed within the disembodied digestive organ.

      <p>While engulfed, the target creature can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and it makes a Concentration check (DC 20+ spell level). An engulfed creature can cut its way outby using claws or alights lashing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, the gizzard immediately melts into a pool of blood and meaty chunks.</p>
      <p>There is no immediate physical exit; the only way for those trapped inside to escape is to cut their way free, to dispel the spell, or to have allies outside destroy the gizzard. The gizzard is fairly easy to strike in combat from a vantage point outside of its interior, due to its size (AC 4). A newly formed hungry gizzard has 5 hit points per caster level. The gizzard is treated like an unattended object for the purpose of saving throws. A hungry gizzard reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed.</p>

      <p>This spell allows you to transfer a number of your spells and the ability to cast them into your familiar. Spontaneous spell casters, such as sorcerers, can imbue a familiar with any spells they know how to cast, subject to the restrictions below. Arcanists who prepare spells, such as wizards, can imbue a familiar with any spell they have currently prepared. In either case, you can imbue one spell per three caster levels, with a maximum spell level of one-third your caster level, rounded down (maximum 5th level). Multiple castings of imbue familiar with spell ability have no effect on these limits.</p>

Once you cast imbue familiar with spell ability on your familiar, both the spell slot from which you cast the spell and the spell slots of the transferred spells remain unavailable for the preparation or casting of new spells until the familiar uses the transferred spells or imbue familiar with spell ability expires.</p>
      <p>The spell can be dispelled; if this happens, the spells transferred are lost as if the familiar had cast them.</p>
      <p>In an antimagic field, the familiar loses the ability to cast the imbued spells, but regains it again if it leaves the field (as long as the spell’s duration hasn’t expired).</p>
      <p>If any transferred spell requires a focus or material component, you must have it on your person when the spells are cast (components are consumed as normal without requiring you to bring them to hand). Any XP costs from a transferred spell are deducted from your total when the familiar casts the spell.</p>

      <p>Singling out the target, you call upon elemental forces to surround it in fire.</p>
      <p>The target of the inferno takes 6d6 points of fire damage unless it makes a Fortitude save. In each round thereafter, the fire deals 1d6 fewer points of damage (minimum 1d6) until the spell ends or the subject manages to extinguish the flames. Thus, the fire deals 5d6 points of damage in the second round, 4d6 points in the third round, and so forth.</p>
      <p>Flammable, non magical items carried by the target automatically fail their saves to resist this damage.</p>
      <p>After the first round, the subject can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save as a full-round action to extinguish the flames before taking additional damage. Rolling on the ground (the subject becomes prone) allows the target a +2 bonus on this save. Leaping into a large body of water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically ends the effect.</p>

      <p>As you complete the spell, your senses dull somewhat. Upon releasing the spell’s energy on your desired subject, your senses clear, although the spell’s recipient can no longer be perceived.</p>
      <p>This powerful glamer functions like invisibility (PH 245), except that it masks image, scent, and sound alike, concealing the subject from all senses except touch. As with greater invisibility, this spell doesn’t end if the subject attacks. While invisible, the subject exudes no scent and is undetectable by scent, blindsense, tremorsense, and blindsight.</p>
      <p>Superior invisibility renders the recipient immune to detection by see invisibility, faerie fire, glitter dust, invisibility purge, and dust of appearance, although creatures under the effect of the spell can be detected by true seeing. Certain mundane conditions (such as leaving footprints) can also render a subject detectable.</p>

      <p>You feel your eyes glow with magical energy as you complete the spell. You see luminous words appear in the air above your spell’s target. The words describe the creature’s strengths or weaknesses, as you desire.</p>
      <p>You gauge the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent to gain combat advantages. Upon casting this spell, you learn a number of strengths or weaknesses of the target equal to one, plus one strength or weakness per two caster levels (maximum four). You can choose to learn strengths, weaknesses, or some combination thereof that you specify. If a creature has more strengths or weaknesses than you can learn with a single casting, you learn the most powerful ones first. Thus, if a monster can use finger of death at will and has resistance to sonic 5, you would learn about finger of death first.</p>
      <p>Strengths can include attack forms and special abilities (including spell like abilities or supernatural abilities).</p>
      <p>Weaknesses include vulnerability to an energy type.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose a 7th-level cleric casts know opponent on a blackarm ored warrior, choosing to learn one strength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informs the cleric’s player that the opponent has the ability to drain energy (a strength), is adversely affected by sunlight, and can be repelled by a holy symbol (both weaknesses). The cleric then concludes that he faces a vampire and breaks out the wooden stakes.</p>

      <p>Your eyes turn red, then take on a golden hue. As you look at the creature, you see small runes dancing around its head. Each rune identifies a particular vulnerability or resistance—red for resistances, green for vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>You learn any special qualities, vulnerabilities, and resistances the target creature has. Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype having vulnerability to fire or a crystalline creature’s susceptibility to the shatter spell). Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks. The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects.</p>

      <p>Upon casting this spell, you become attuned to the specific creature that owns the spell’s focus item. (A creature is considered to own an item if it was the last creature to carry the item on its person for 24 hours or more. You do not count when considering what creature was last to carry an item.) This attunement grants you a +10 bonus on Search and Survival checks made to track the item’s owner or find evidence of the owner’s passage. This spell does not give you insight into who or what the creature you are attuned to is or where that creature ultimately might be. Also, the spell does not provide a trail that is not already there nor provide you with the benefit of the Track feat.</p>

The subject can’t make any attack against a creature other than you.</p>
      <p>The subject of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by nome ans rendered idiotic or suicidal. For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach you.</p>

      <p>This spell functions like true domination (page 224), except that the subject can be any creature and is permanently dominated if it fails its initial Will save.</p>
      <p>A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a–4 penalty to resist taking that particular action. If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.</p>

      <p>A 3-foot-long blazing beam of moonlight springs forth from your hand.</p>
      <p>You callas wordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with proficiency. However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus.</p>
      <p>Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow.</p>
      <p>The blade is immaterial, and your</p>
      <p>Strength modifier does not apply to the damage.</p>
      <p>A successful moonblade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target’s next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like ability. The DC is equal to 10+ damage dealt + spell level. (An opponent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid losing the spell in addition to the check on its next turn.)</p>

      <p>As you cast this spell, pure, pale moonlight shapes itself into a stair or bridge, as you desire.</p>
      <p>Moonpath allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon’s length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair.</p>
      <p>At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path.</p>
      <p>Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell sanctuary except that the save DC is 15+ your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.</p>
      <p>Unlike a wall of force, a moonpath can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen’s disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.</p>
      <p>It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path.</p>
      <p>A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed.</p>
      <p>If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails.</p>
      <p>The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees.</p>

      <p>On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone of light points.</p>
      <p>Light from a moonbeam spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creature’s next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam.</p>

      <p>With a final wave of your hand, the ground beneath your feet trembles and the landscape shifts into a new form.</p>
      <p>You shape a natural setting into a formidable defensive position. Usually this spell is used to prepare an open outdoor area such as a hillside or a forest, but a large natural cavern could be shaped into a divine rampart. Artificial structures or features are not affected, although nature’s rampart could be positioned to fill a gap between two buildings or barricade an unpaved road. The effect of the spell depends on the terrain:</p>
      <p>Open Outdoor Site: A rampart or dike of earth 5 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base rises immediately behind a shallow ditch 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep along the perimeter of the site.</p>
      <p>Creatures behind the dike receive cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then climbing 10 feet to reach the top of the dike (Climb DC 10).</p>
      <p>Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern: Loose stones and boulders, dead wood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive cover.</p>
      <p>Marshy or Low-Lying Site: In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, nature’s rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to 1/4 their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run.</p>
      <p>Focus: A small quartz gem engraved with the image of an exquisite tiny castle, worth at least 100 gp.</p>

      <p>You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in midair, burying your foes and sending them to a frosty death.</p>
      <p>An obedient avalanche spell affects creatures differently, depending on where they are in relation to the avalanche.</p>
      <p>Within 20 feet of the Center Point:</p>
      <p>Creatures take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.</p>
      <p>Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (DMG 90). All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. A buried creature can free itself with a</p>
      <p>DC 20 Strength check as a full-round action, and can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A trapped creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand.</p>
      <p>Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the</p>
      <p>Center Point: Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex negates).</p>
      <p>Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed. The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell. All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would.</p>
      <p>Terrain and Structures: The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (DMG 91) even after the snow melts. Structures struck by an obedient avalanche take 1d6×10 points of damage.</p>
      <p>An obedient avalanche extinguishes all flames it touches, whether they are normal or magical.</p>

      <p>A brief supplication gives you avision that hints at how dangerous the immediate future is likely to be.</p>
      <p>Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour’s journey: safety, peril, or great danger.</p>
      <p>The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; the DM makes the roll secretly.</p>
      <p>If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.</p>
      <p>•  Safety: You aren’t in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.</p>
      <p>•  Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.</p>
      <p>•  Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful</p>
      <p>NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.</p>
      <p>If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don’t necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.</p>
      <p>Choosing which vision is “correct” takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters’ likely courses of action and what dangers they’re likely to face.</p>
      <p>The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, across roads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.</p>
      <p>Unlike the more powerful augury spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn’t respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.</p>
      <p>Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp.</p>

      <p>This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing</p>
      <p>Chaos of Limbo (DMG 158) is just what the plane’s name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of “raw” limbo must make a DC 16</p>
      <p>Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.</p>
      <p>The per inarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature’s control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire,</p>
      <p>A pavilion of grandeur spell provides adventurers with a spectacular resting place between battles adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.</p>
      <p>The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom).</p>
      <p>If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.</p>
      <p>You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.</p>
      <p>Thick Barrier: You can “thicken” empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.</p>
      <p>Fiery Barrier: You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.</p>
      <p>Complete Barrier: You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone.</p>

      <p>Reaching into your foe’s mind, you weave an illusion of his most hated foe.</p>
      <p>You create a phantasmal image of the subject’s most hated enemy by sifting through the subconscious mind of the subject. Only you and the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal creature, and the phantasm seems blurry and indistinct to you. If the target fails its Will saving throw, you designate a space that the phantasm appears to occupy. The subject must attack the phantasm, or move to be adjacent to it.</p>
      <p>A creature that attacks the phantasm is allowed an additional saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If moving up to the phantasm would cause the subject to cross dangerous terrain (such as a pool of lava), it does not move to be adjacent to the phantasm. It merely moves as close as it can and takes no further actions unless the phantasm moves to a space it can reach.</p>
      <p>As a move action, you can move a phantasmal decoy up to 60 feet in any direction. Because it’s not real, a phantasmal decoy isn’t affected by terrain that slows movement (although you can slow its progress voluntarily if you like to help maintain the facade of realism).</p>

      <p>You create ever-shifting phantasmal terrain and landmarks that confuse the subject when it tries to move. The very ground shifts and twists beneath the subject’s feet, and the landscape moves of its own accord.</p>
      <p>The subject finds it nearly impossible to walk in a straight line.</p>
      <p>The target of a phantasmal disorientation spell must make a Will save after this spell is cast to discern true landmarks from phantasmal ones. If the save succeeds, the creature moves and acts normally. If the save fails, it instead moves in a direction 90 degrees to either side (equal chance of going left or right), and cannot target any creature with ranged attacks or ranged spells.</p>
      <p>Because of the disorientation, the subject doesn’t realize it’s headed in the wrong direction until it meaningfully interacts with its environment (by making an attack or manipulating an object such as a door, for example). For the duration of the spell, an affected creature must succeed on a Will save each round to move normally.</p>
      <p>A phantasmal disorientation spell affects only the direction of movement and attacks made at range. Creatures subject to it can still make melee attacks, cast personal or touch spells, or otherwise act normally.</p>

      <p>There is a wrinkle of force that flashes briefly; then it evaporates, leaving only the promise of power behind.</p>
      <p>An invisible force, not unlike the product of an unseen servant spell (PH 297), comes into being where you wish. On your turn, this force steals objects from others as you inaudibly direct it (a free action). A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature or can pick up an unattended object, as long as the object weighs no more than 1 pound per caster level. It cannot break into locked chests. A phantasmal thief has a Hide modifier (useful against those who can see invisible creatures) and a</p>
      <p>Move Silently modifier both equal to your caster level.</p>
      <p>If a phantasmal thief goes undetected, it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not holding or wearing.</p>
      <p>Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can steal objects, bring objects to you, or put them back where they came from. It can take no other actions.</p>
      <p>A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to you.</p>
      <p>A phantasmal thief can hold only one object at a time, and the object becomes invisible in its grasp.</p>
      <p>A thief cannot take an item if it is detected by the creature it’s trying to steal from (with a Listen or Spot check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled.</p>
      <p>A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature’s hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so with a bonus on the disarm check equal to your caster level. If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears after it brings the stolen object to you.</p>

      <p>By waving around a tiny pewter figurine and picturing in your mind the figurine attacking the target creature, you complete the spell. You feel a phantasmal force leap from the figurine toward your target.</p>
      <p>If the target creature fails its saving throw, this spell creates in the subject’s mind an illusory double of whichever creature currently threatens it that it deems most dangerous. The form of this phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects.</p>
      <p>First, the subject believes it is being flanked by the phantom foe and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can’t be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell.</p>
      <p>Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the phantom foe is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the phantom foe, that creature benefits from a 50% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject’s inability to tell the phantom foe from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment.</p>
      <p>Creatures other than the subject cannot see the phantom foe, although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts. If the subject is not threatened by any creature at the start of its turn, the spell ends.</p>

      <p>The phantom stag has an AC of 20 (–1 size, +6 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 40 hit points +5 hit points per caster level. It attacks with its antlers at a +10 bonus, dealing 1d8+9 points of damage (doubled on a successful charge). It can also trample Medium or smaller foes, who must succeed on a Reflex save (18+1/2 your caster level) or take 1d6+9 points of damage as the stag moves through their space.</p>
      <p>A phantom stag has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 300 feet. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level in other gear. It ignores terrain elements such as undergrowth, rubble, or mud that would slow its movement.</p>
      <p>Phantom stags gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those associated with any lower caster levels. 12th Level: The phantoms tag can use air walk at will (as the spell, PH 196, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. The phantom stag gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. 14th Level: The phantom stag can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).</p>
      <p>The phantom stag gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC. 16th Level: The phantoms tag’s antlers have the ghost touch (DMG 224) and wounding (DMG 226) weapon special abilities. The phantom stag gains a +6 deflection bonus to AC. 18th Level: The phantoms tag can use etherealness on behalf of its rider (as the spell, PH 228, caster level 18th).</p>
      <p>The phantom stag gains a +8 deflection bonus to AC.</p>

      <p>You create the sensation in the subject’s mind that it is threatened by more foes than it actually faces. Though the subject doesn’t actually perceive any additional enemies (and thus doesn’t waste any attacks on the phantasm), a creature affected by this spell is considered flanked, even if not threatened by other creatures. No amount of convincing by others can help the subject of this spell avoid its effect—only a successful saving throw against the spell when initially cast can help the target.

The poison from the thorns deals 1d4 points of Strength damage immediately and another 1d4 points of Strength damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 10+1/2 your caster level + your</p>
      <p>Wis modifier).</p>

      <p>In an instant you cause glistening green vines to spring up at your command.</p>
      <p>This spell functions like vine mine (page 230), except that the vines you create are poisonous (contact, 1d6 Dex/2d6</p>

A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the spell’s area (and again 1 minute later); creatures don’t have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within). You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your caster level to share this immunity.</p>

      <p>Portal alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size passes through the magic gate or portal the spell is cast upon. You decide at the time of casting whether the portal alarm will be mental or audible.</p>
      <p>Mental Alarm: Amental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area and on the same plane. You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting). A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.</p>
      <p>Audible Alarm: An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes.</p>
      <p>The ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round.</p>
      <p>Creatures within the area of a silence spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a silence spell, no alarm is sounded.</p>
      <p>Ethereal and astral creatures trigger a portal alarm if they pass through the portal.</p>
      <p>You can set a portal alarm with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password can be discerned with the analyze portal spell (page 10). Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm.</p>

      <p>You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with a ray to strike a target, but each ray uses a +6 bonus on attack rolls instead of your ranged attack bonus.</p>
      <p>A target struck by a ray suffers the effect of one beam of a prismatic spray spell (roll 1d8 to determine the effect, rerolling any result of 8), except that the save DC (if applicable) is 19. After a particular color of ray has been used, it is no longer available to the eye, and die rolls that indicate the same color are rerolled. Once all seven rays have been fired, the eye remains until the spell’s duration expires. You can still move it, but it can fire no more rays.</p>
      <p>The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 (+8 size) and 9 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for saving throws.</p>

      <p>As you finish the complicated procedure necessary to cast the spell, your target’s mind opens up to you like a book. You see the target’s memories likes tories and know that you can rewrite them as a master bard rewrites the inferior works of his apprentices.</p>
      <p>You can selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as you see fit. Casting the spell gives you access to all of the subject’s thoughts and memories, allowing you to implement as many of the following specific effects as you like.</p>
      <p>Memory Erasure: Memories possessed by the subject can be erased, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. You can erase up to one full week of memories from the subject’s mind.</p>
      <p>Memory Implant: You can create false memories in the subject’s mind as you see fit. You can implant memories of being friends with a hated enemy, events that didn’t really take place, or betrayals by people the subject regards as friends.</p>
      <p>Negative Levels: You can bestow a number of negative levels equal to 1/2 the subject’s character level (rounding down, minimum 1st level) or less. This effect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levels never become permanent level loss, but they cannot be removed by spells such as restoration, instead returning at a rate of one level per day.</p>
      <p>Persona Rebuilding: By erasing the subject’s previous personality and implanting a false set of memories, you can build a new persona for the creature, altering its alignment, beliefs, values, and personality traits. (Some class abilities might be affected by alignment changes.)</p>
      <p>Programmed Trigger: You can program the subject to delay the onset of any of the above effects until a specific event takes place, such as the receipt of a coded message, capture by enemies, or arrival at some destination. Similarly, you could specify some or all of the alterations you create in a subject to be removed by a specific event.</p>
      <p>The nature of programmed amnesia is such that a subject given new memories (whether willing or not) might be given cause to suspect that those memories are false, based on how complete your programming is. For example, a paladin subject to a persona rebuilding effect that changes her alignment to neutral loses her paladin abilities. Unless you impart a specific believable memory of why she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gap in her memory and might take steps (such as seeking a magical cure for her “amnesia”) that could negate the spell’s effect (see below).</p>
      <p>Generally, your subject must be either willing to undergo the spell or restrained in some way so that it cannot leave or interfere with the casting. Programmed amnesia cannot be dispelled, and so is normally permanent unless you care to specify events that will end the effect. Its effect can also be removed by a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell.</p>

Its movements look awkward, and its actions aren’t as effective as if it were actually doing them itself.

If that save is successful, the subject collapses, helpless and in a comatose state, for 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p>Water roils and foams as the shipwreck rises to the surface. Floating now effortlessly, it bobs up and down, never sinking more than an inch.</p>
      <p>A rainbow blast spell strikes foes with every type of energy</p>
      <p>The subject of this spell gains magical buoyancy and floats on the surface of the water for the duration of the spell, despite its weight or normal buoyancy.</p>
      <p>It cannot swim below the surface of the water. Creatures that must breathe water can still do so. If the subject is underwater at the time this spell is cast, it rises toward the surface at a speed of 150 feet. The magic of the spell prevents the subject from taking damage from the speed of the ascent.</p>
      <p>This spell is particularly effective at raising sunken ships from the deep. If you know the exact details of the shipwreck (its appearance, its name, the date of its creation, its history, and the circumstances of its sinking), the vertical distance between you and the subject is not a factor. When cast to raise a shipwreck, the spell brings up all surviving fragments of the ship, along with any loose objects that are in contact with the ship or enclosed inside it. The ship and its fragments remain on the surface of the ocean until the spell’s duration ends, at which point the ship sinks again if it has not been repaired. (Multiple consecutive castings of the spell might be needed to keep the ship afloat long enough to be fully repaired.)</p>

If successful, the ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). The target must also make a Reflex save or be frozen to the ground with its feet encased in ice. A frozen creature cannot move, receives no Dexterity bonus to AC, and incurs a–2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
      <p>A frozen creature can free itself with a DC 18 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the ice.</p>

      <p>Bringing to your lips some of the most elemental words of arcane power, you feel stirring within you the spirits of ancient mages as you prepare to absorb the spell energies you have targeted. Your body shakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells.</p>
      <p>This spell functions like dispel magic (PH 223), except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with greater dispel magic) you have a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can’t dispel that effect. When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself.</p>
      <p>When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25+ spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object.</p>
      <p>Each spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell’s effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven’t done so already (see below).</p>
      <p>If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell’s effect as if you had cast it yourself.</p>
      <p>You can still attempt to reave a spell you didn’t identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don’t know the specifics of the spell’s effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target.</p>
      <p>If you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25+ spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don’t know.</p>
      <p>If the redirected spell’s correct casting conditions aren’t met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails. pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsRANDOM PLANAR DESTINATIONS</p>
      <p>Spells such as prismatic spray, reality maelstrom, and scramble portal, and items such as an amulet of the planes and a staff of power can send an individual to a random plane. The list of available planes varies according to the cosmology you’ve chosen. An example using the D&amp;D cosmology is presented in the next column.</p>
      <p>Transitive Planes such as the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, and the Plane of Shadow should not be considered for such random destinations.</p>
      <p>The layer and exact location on the particular plane is up to the DM. Transportation to a random plane does not guarantee survival there, and individuals who risk such effects should be aware of the dangers.</p>
      <p>If an individual is someplace other than the Material Plane when randomly switching planes, simply replace the plane of origin’s entry on the table with the Material Plane. Thus, a staff of power broken on the Elemental Plane of Fire sends the wielder to the Material Plane if a 91 is rolled.</p>

      <p>Your ush to your fallen companion amid the chaos of the battle and cry out the words that will bring her back for one last fight.</p>
      <p>This spell brings a dead ally temporarily back to life. The subject can have been dead for up to 1 round per level.</p>
      <p>Your target functions as if a raise dead spell (PH 268) had been cast upon her, except that she does not lose a level and has half of her full normal hit points. She is alive (not undead) for the duration of the spell and can be healed normally, but dies as soon as the spell ends. While under the effect of this spell, the subject is not affected by spells that raise the dead.</p>
      <p>The subject gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks against the creature that killed her.</p>

      <p>You pocket the items, but the radiance remains.</p>
      <p>This spell functions like protection from arrows (PH 266), except as noted here. If any projectile fired from a ranged weapon that strikes you has all its damage negated by your damage reduction (10/magic), the projectile is turned back upon the creature that fired it. The attacker’s attack roll is used to determine if the reversed projectile strikes the attacker, but the damage is rerolled. If the attacker is also protected by a reverse arrows spell, it is possible for the projectile to bounce between both individuals until one of the spells is discharged from accumulated damage.</p>
      <p>Once this spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.</p>

You can revive a destroyed undead creature that has been inactive for up to one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s animating spirit must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s animating spirit is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects that want to revive receive no saving throw.</p>
      <p>Revive undead restores hit points to the subject up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die. The body of the undead to be revived must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is reanimated. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.</p>
      <p>An undead that has been destroyed by a turning effect can’t be revived by this spell.</p>
      <p>The subject of the spell loses one level or Hit Die (if it doesn’t have a character class level, it loses a HD) when it is revived. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Charisma instead. An undead that was destroyed with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being revived, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting undead creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.</p>

      <p>After an intonation and clasping of the subject creature, you grant it knowledge of where safety lies.</p>
      <p>The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct direction to a place of safety, with safety being defined as a location where the individual is not taking immediate damage from the environment, and immediate damage is not imminent. It does not provide the means for the subject to move in that direction.</p>
      <p>A safety spell points out the shortest distance out of a poisonous cloud, or the direction one should dig to reach the surface if entombed in earth. It does not function against the maze spell, because that spell deals no physical damage. Nor does the spell provide knowledge of or protection against the creatures that inhabit those safe places.</p>
      <p>In the D&amp;D cosmology (DMG 150), safety has the following effects when cast on specific planes.</p>
      <p>Plane of Shadow: Shortest route out of dark lands.</p>
      <p>Elemental Plane of Air: Nearest windproof shelter, shortest route out of smoke bank.</p>
      <p>Elemental Plane of Earth: Nearest air pocket or open cavern.</p>
      <p>Elemental Plane of Fire: Shortest route out of magma pools or other unusually hot places.</p>
      <p>Elemental Plane of Water: Nearest pocket of breathable air; shortest route out of hot spot, ice pocket, or red tide.</p>
      <p>Negative Energy Plane: Nearest doldrum area with the minor negative-dominant trait.</p>
      <p>Positive Energy Plane: Nearest edge zone with the minor positive-dominant trait.</p>
      <p>Limbo: Nearest area of stabilized limbo.</p>
      <p>Pandemonium: Nearest shelter from a windstorm.</p>
      <p>Carceri: Shortest route out of a Minethys sandstorm.</p>
      <p>Gehenna: Nearest flat ledge, nearest shelter from Mungoth’s acidic snow.</p>
      <p>Nine Hells: Nearest shelter from fireballs on Avernus, rockslides on</p>
      <p>Malbolge, or cold on Cania.</p>
      <p>Acheron: Nearest shelter from Ocan thus blade storms.</p>
      <p>On planes you create yourself, safety might provide other information.</p>
      <p>This spell is mostly used in hostile environments, such as one of the Inner</p>
      <p>Planes, to locate the nearest pocket of habitable space.</p>
      <p>If safety is cast and then followed by a plane shift spell (PH 262), the plane shift sends the subject of safety to a place of relative safety on that plane. It is transported to a pocket of air on the</p>
      <p>Elemental Plane of Water, for example, or a cool spot on the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>

      <p>You intone the spell, and an enormous handmade out of thick gray fog floats in the air before you.</p>
      <p>You create a floating Medium hand made of shadow material. A shadow hand is an opaque gray color, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide with its fingers outstretched. It can grant total concealment against a single opponent you designate, carry materials as Tenser’s floating disk (PH 294), or point or gesture as a normal hand does.</p>
      <p>The hand has an AC of 18 (+6 natural, +2 deflection) and has half as many hit points as your full normal total. It can be damaged just as Big by’s interposing hand (PH 204) can be, and it makes all saving throws as if it were you.</p>
      <p>Changing the hand’s task or target is a standard action, and it can move anywhere in range. If not given any commands, the hand follows you at your speed, maintaining the same distance from you. The spell ends if the hand moves out of the spell’s range.</p>
      <p>If carrying items and commanded to do something else, the hand drops whatever it is holding to complete its task (you can order the hand to rid itself of items gently as a standard action). Unlike Tenser’s floating disk, it does not have to follow you at a fixed distance—you direct where the hand goes.</p>

      <p>By infusing the nearby landscape with power stolen from the Plane of Shadow, you make the surrounding terrain a more savage, dangerous place.</p>
      <p>The spell’s exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast.</p>
      <p>Desert: The spell transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly.</p>
      <p>The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see</p>
      <p>Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers, DMG 302–303). Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis.</p>
      <p>Forest: Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape’s DC).</p>
      <p>Hill: Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25</p>
      <p>Climb check to ascend or descend.</p>
      <p>Marsh: Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (DMG 88).</p>
      <p>Mountain: The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale.</p>
      <p>Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (DMG 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5, 000 feet are treated as the 5, 000-to 15, 000-foot category, and anything above 5, 000 feet is treated as being above 15, 000 feet.</p>
      <p>The shadow landscape spell brings a bit of the Plane of Shadow to the Material Plane</p>
      <p>Plain: Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape’s DC).</p>
      <p>Underground: Ordinary dungeons aren’t affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are.</p>
      <p>Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.</p>
      <p>In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell’s area. When rolling random weather (DMG 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground.</p>
      <p>You don’t suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher</p>
      <p>Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster level sasa designated traveler. Creatures so designated don’t suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they’re still subject to the bad weather.</p>
      <p>You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell’s area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians.</p>
      <p>As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell’s area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, dark vision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and low light vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.</p>

If they take penalties in bright illumination, they take them for the duration of their exposure to this light. Additionally, they are dazzled while in the area of the spell. Those who escape the area of a shadow radiance spell completely recover within 1 round. Those who make their saves and those outside the initial burst see only the equivalent of torchlight emanating from the center of the area.</p>
      <p>Material Component: A flame at least the size of a torch.</p>

      <p>Upon casting this spell, you create a shadowy forcet hat automatically grabs the target (PH 156). The shadowy force immediately attempts to establish a hold on the target with a grapple check bonus equal to the DC of this spell. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the grapple check bonus of the shadowy grappler is cut in half. For example, a sorcerer with a 16 Charisma who casts this spell creates a shadowy grappler with a grapple check bonus of +19 if the target fails its save and +9 if the target makes its save.</p>
      <p>Every round on your turn, the shadowy grappler makes a grapple check against the target. Once it has a hold, the shadowy force attempts to pin the target on the following round. If the grappler establishes a pin, it uses the option to prevent the target from speaking. The grappler always attempts to maintain a grapple or work toward a pin.</p>
      <p>A shadowy grappler occupies the same square as the target and moves with the target for as long as the spell lasts.</p>

      <p>This spell simultaneously hides a path or road specified by you, while simultaneously creating an illusory path. The illusory path starts at a point chosen by you within the range of the spell. It continues in the direction you indicate, to the limit of the spell’s area, where it ends abruptly. The illusory path avoids obstacles and provides no bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps, or other methods of traversing such obstacles.</p>
      <p>There is no way to force the illusory path to lead over a cliff or across a river more than 4 feet deep.</p>
      <p>Those who fail their Will saves struggle along the illusory path. If vegetation or rough terrain slows their progress, they believe the path is sloping enough to justify the reduced speed.

      <p>In addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll.</p>
      <p>Magical fire used against a target in this spell’s area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die.</p>

      <p>This spell transforms one of your arms into a poisonous serpent. As an attack action, you can strike an opponent with your snake arm by making a successful melee attack. The bite from the venomous serpent deals damage equal to 1d3 points + your Str modifier, and it carries a toxic venom that deals 2 points of Constitution damage as initial and secondary damage. Each instance of ability damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC equal to this spell’s DC).</p>

      <p>You finish casting this spell, and the area around you is abuzz with a low, droning hum that improves your concentration.</p>
      <p>After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast within the duration that requires concentration to maintain is maintained for you until the sonorous hum spell expires. This effect allows you to cast other spells, even another spell that also requires concentration. If the spell maintained by the sonorous hum has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would, and you gain no further benefits from this casting of sonorous hum. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 Listen check to detect). You can end the spell as a free action.</p>
      <p>For example, you could cast this spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this spell maintains the concentration on detect thoughts while you cast discern lies and maintain concentration on that spell yourself. You control all aspects of both spells, so you could change the orientation of the detect thoughts effect and select a different target for your discern lies spell in the same round.</p>
      <p>A sound lance is visible as waves in the air</p>

      <p>For the duration of the spell, the undead creature is subject to extra damage from critical hits (and thus sneak attacks), nonlethal damage, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, and damage to its physical ability scores (though it still lacks a Constitution score and thus can’t take Constitution damage) as if it were alive.</p>
      <p>It loses its immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save, as well as its invulnerability to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects. However, an undead affected by this spell gains a bonus on its Fortitude saves equal to its Charisma bonus (if any). (The bonus doesn’t apply to</p>
      <p>Fortitude saves against effects that also affect objects.) It must breathe, eat, and sleep just like a normal living creature (though the last two aren’t likely to come into play thanks to the spell’s short duration).</p>

      <p>Joining mysterious phrases with the simple motion of flexing your fingers, you imbue your hands with receptive magical energy that crackles and glows a soft orange.</p>
      <p>You are able to hold the charge for one touch spell per arm of your body as long as you don’t use a changed limb to cast another spell or touch anything with it. Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb.</p>
      <p>For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).</p>
      <p>A spectral weapon appears fearsome at first glance</p>
      <p>A mar i lith spell caster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells.</p>
      <p>She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural abilities, since those do not interfere with holding a charge.</p>
      <p>If the spell flower effect ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate.</p>

      <p>This spell protects one creature from a single 1st-or 2nd-level spell. The creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the chosen spell. Lesser spell immunity can’t protect a creature from a spell to which spell resistance doesn’t apply. This spell works against other spells, spell-like effects, and innate spell-like abilities.</p>
      <p>It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells with similar effects; thus, a creature given immunity to inflict light wounds is still susceptible to inflict moderate wounds.</p>
      <p>A creature can have only one lesser spell immunity or spell immunity (PH 282) in effect at a time.</p>

      <p>You call upon the power of the dinosaurs to complete the spell. A set of ghostly dinosaur jaws comes into being and attacks the creature you designate.</p>
      <p>This spell creates a set of powerful jaws of force. The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The spirit jaws use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wis modifier as its attack bonus.</p>
      <p>If an initial attack hits, the spirit jaws deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action. The jaws’ bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus +4.</p>
      <p>Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and cannot move. The target creature no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it.</p>
      <p>The set of jaws always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws.</p>
      <p>If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. Attacking the set of jaws has no effect. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but disintegrate or a sphere of annihilation destroys the effect.</p>
      <p>The grappled opponent can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and a Concentration check (DC 20+ spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the set of jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful Escape Artist check as a standard action opposed by the set of jaws’ grapple check.</p>
      <p>As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned.</p>
      <p>A pinned opponent is held immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks (granted by your attack bonus), you can use them to cause damage to a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against that target.</p>
      <p>If you become unable to command the jaws, they vanish.</p>

Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of elemental fury’s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast. 2nd Round: Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to all creatures in the storm. 3rd Round: A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50% chance). The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement in half. 4th Round: Flame pelts the area beneath the storm cloud, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) (Reflex half).</p>

      <p>Holding forth a miniature rudder, you touch the targets hip. Immediately you feel connected to it, knowing the intricate details of its construction. You sense an invisible aura surrounding the ship and permeating its every space. Although it seems to be riding lower in the water than its weight would suggest, you instinctively know that you can control its every movement.</p>
      <p>You grant the ship touched a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to move beneath the surface of the water.</p>
      <p>You can control the ship’s speed and direction as a free action. All interior spaces of the ship remain dry even if a doorway or porthole is open while the ship is underwater. Any creature aboard the ship when the spell is cast can move about the ship with ease (including climbing and jumping) as if it were afloat on a calm sea. Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement.</p>
      <p>You can transfer control of the ship to another individual by giving that individual the miniature rudder you used as a focus to cast the spell. If the focus is ever lost or becomes unattended, the spell’s duration expires.</p>
      <p>Once the spell ends (either because the duration expired, the focus was lost or became unattended, or the magic was successfully dispelled), the magic lingers for 1 additional round per caster level. During this time, the ship ascends toward the water’s surface at a rate of 60 feet per round. If the ship is still underwater when this additional time runs out, it immediately sinks, and its passengers risk drowning.</p>

      <p>The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell.</p>

      <p>You call into being a gigantic, roughly humanoid creature composed entirely of elemental matter. The creature immediately attacks a nearby enemy.</p>
      <p>You conjure a tremendously powerful creature known as an elemental monolith (Complete Arcane 156). It appears at the spot you designate and acts immediately on your turn, attacking your opponents to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell’s effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.</p>
      <p>If you speak the elemental monolith’s language and are close enough to communicate with it, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.</p>
      <p>A monolith can’t be summoned into an environment hostile to it in any way (for example, you couldn’t summon a fire monolith underwater or an earth monolith high in midair).</p>
      <p>When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water crea ture, it becomes a spell of that type.</p>
      <p>Material Component: A gem worth 100 gp—aquamarine for air, tourmaline for earth, garnet for fire, or pearl for water.</p>

      <p>A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the subject’s slumbering mind is filled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim’s first attempt to sleep, it incurs a–2 penalty on</p>

      <p>The subject does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full night’s rest.</p>

A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.</p>
      <p>Tortoiseshell slows a creature’s movement as if it were wearing heavy armor.</p>
      <p>An elf subject to tortoise shell, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round.</p>
      <p>The spell affects only a creature’s speed; tortoise shell doesn’t carry an armor check penalty or an arcane spell failure chance.</p>

      <p>You place a protective spell upon your hand that allows you to touch an untriggered magic sigil (such as a glyph of warding or a symbol of death) without setting it off. The touched sigil is removed from its location and held as magical potential on your hand, as though it were a touch spell.</p>
      <p>To pick up a sigil in this manner, you must make a successful caster level check (DC 20+ the target glyph’s spell level). Failure indicates that you have triggered the glyph or symbol. If you successfully transfer the sigil to your hand, you can use a standard action to place it on a surface (not a creature) of the sort on which it can normally be scribed. The transferred sigil works normally thereafter and retains all its original triggering conditions, although its current location might make its triggers difficult or impossible to achieve.</p>
      <p>You can maintain the magic sigil on your hand as long as you concentrate.</p>
      <p>If your concentration lapses or the spell duration expires while the sigil is thus stored as potential, it immediately triggers upon you (and only you), even if you normally would not meet its trigger conditions. The effect has the same saving throw and spell resistance as the original spell did. The only safe way to rid yourself of the stored sigil is to place it upon a suitable surface.</p>

Subjects in the area that fail their saves immediately become aware of the condition, but they cannot communicate it due to their paralyzed state (although someone could use a spell such as detect thoughts to ascertain the condition).

      <p>You can control the actions of any humanoid. You establish a telepathic link with the subject’s mind. If a common language is shared, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.”</p>
      <p>You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it.</p>
      <p>Subjects have a chance of resisting this control by making a Will save to avoid the effect when the spell is cast. Those affected by the spell and then forced to take actions against their nature receive a new saving throw with a–4 penalty. Obviously self-destructive orders might be carried out, unless the subject can make a saving throw with the–4 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.</p>
      <p>Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or dispel it.</p>

      <p>The eldest, most powerful forces of elemental water heed your summons and obey your request. These forces of pure elemental power gather together a wall of water that moves inexorably in the direction of your choice, crushing all that it encounters.</p>
      <p>This spell creates a towering tsunami and sends it forth in a powerful wave to smash all in its path. The tsunami starts at any point you select within range of the spell and then moves at a speed of 60 feet in any direction chosen by you. Once the direction is set, the tsunami cannot change course. The tsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all in its path. Anything struck can make a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Gargantuan or larger creatures that fail the save are knocked prone. Huge or smaller creatures that fail the save are picked up and carried with the wave. Each round a victim is carried by the tsunami, it takes the bludgeoning damage again and can make an additional Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures being carried by a tsunami cannot move in any other way. They can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20+ spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a tsunami take a–4 penalty to Dexterity and a–2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escape the wave by making successful</p>
      <p>DC 20 Swim checks, as long as they end their movement outside the effect of the tsunami.</p>
      <p>Any creature that comes in contact with a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is considered to have been struck by the tsunami’s movement. A creature can attempt to extract another creature caught by a tsunami, providing the rescuer resists being swept up or knocked down by the tsunami and can reach the victim</p>
      <p>Extracting a victim in this manner requires a DC 20 Strength check.</p>
      <p>A tsunami’s progress can be halted by anything that would normally block line of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy the intervening object or creature. If only a portion of the tsunami is blocked, the rest of it continues on.</p>
      <p>Although this spell can be cast on dry land, it is most effective when cast on the open sea. In this case, saving throws to avoid full damage are made with a–4 penalty, and the width of the tsunami increases to 40 feet per caster level. A tsunami that begins on water but then travels onto land immediately shrinks to its land size and speed. A tsunami does not vanish if it moves beyond the spell’s initial range.</p>

The effect of a statue spell is also ended, and a magic jar is shattered—forever destroyed—and the life force within snuffed out.

      <p>Individuals bound to service are not freed (including creatures such as familiars, invisible stalkers, genies, and elementals). An antimagic field is not affected, nor does the effect of unbinding penetrate one. A magic circle against evil (or another alignment) that currently holds a creature imprisoned is dispelled.</p>
      <p>Curses and geas/quest spells are negated only if you are of a level equal to or greater than that of the original caster.</p>

      <p>A churning in your stomach overtakes you as you complete the spell. Something slithers up your throat, and you vomit serpents.</p>
      <p>This spell summons 1d4+1 celestial or fiendish Medium vipers (MM 280), which leap forth from your mouth to attack your enemies.</p>
      <p>A celestial viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite evil attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll.</p>
      <p>A fiendish viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite good attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll.</p>
      <p>Starting in the round you complete the spell, you can spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a move action. (Thus, if you move and then cast this spell, you cannot spit any vipers until your next turn, but if you cast this spell without moving, you can spit forth one viper as your move action in that round.) Spat vipers land at your feet in an adjacent square of your choice and act on the same round, on your turn, just as creatures summoned by a summon monster spell do.</p>
      <p>The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and they do not interfere with your breathing. However, until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech. When the spell’s duration expires, all the vipers disappear, and any not yet brought forth are lost.</p>
      <p>When you use a summoning spell to summon a good creature or an evil creature, it is a spell of that type.</p>

      <p>When you attack with avis cid glob, you make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you miss, the glob might strike a nearby square or creature (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon,</p>

      <p>A Medium or smaller creature struck by the glob must make a successful Reflex save or be instantly stuck in place. A stuck creature can speak but is otherwise limited to purely mental actions (such as casting spells with no somatic or material components) and attempts to free itself by means of a Strength check or Escape Artist check (against a DC equal to this spell’s DC) made as a full-round action. A Large or larger creature stuck in the goo can’t move from the spot where it is glued, but it can otherwise act normally.</p>
      <p>The glob dissipates when the spell duration expires. Until then, it remains sticky, and any creature touching it (for example, a creature attempting to pull out an ally) must make a successful Reflex save or become stuck itself.</p>
      <p>A creature stuck by such secondary contact is not trapped as thoroughly as a creature targeted by the glob, however, so the DC of the Strength check or Escape Artist check required to get free is reduced by 5.</p>

      <p>By flexing your arm and speaking the repetitive words of power, you unleash the spell. In the distance, the ground is covered in a writhing mass.

      <p>With a rush of hot air, a swirling wall of blowing sand leaps into being.</p>
      <p>This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand.</p>
      <p>The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a</p>
      <p>Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.</p>
      <p>Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe.</p>
      <p>Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20+ spell level).</p>
      <p>Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.</p>
      <p>Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extin guished.</p>

      <p>Composed of a sheet of water rising vertically, the transparent wall does not prevent you from seeing beyond it. The water of the wall is calm as a lake on a windless day.</p>
      <p>This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature’s next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.</p>
      <p>Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.</p>
      <p>Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed.</p>

Any creature or object that comes in contact with it must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage.

      <p>Only the smallest of watercraft, such as canoes, kayaks, or coracles, can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft can make a Profession (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save if it so chooses to avoid being sucked up.</p>

The weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, chosen by you at the time of casting. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of that energy type on a successful hit. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d10 points of energy damage.

      <p>This spell can be cast on a weapon that already deals energy damage, and if the weapon already creates the same type of damage as the spell, the effects stack. For example, if cast on a +1 flaming longsword to give it additional fire damage, the weapon now deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage per hit.</p>
      <p>This spell has a descriptor that is the same as the energy created by the target weapon. For example, weapon of energy is a fire spell when used to give a weapon bonus fire damage.</p>

      <p>Wielding the weapon your deity favors, you call upon that divine force to imbue it with power.</p>
      <p>You must be holding your deity’s favored weapon to cast this spell. You can use the weapon as if you had proficiency with it even if you normally do not. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and an additional special ability (see the list below). A double weapon gains this enhancement bonus and special ability for only one of its two ends, as chosen by you.</p>
      <p>When you reach caster level 9th, the enhancement bonus of the weapon increases to +2. At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3, at 15th level it is +4, and at 18th level it becomes +5.</p>
      <p>The list below includes deities from the core pantheon as well as other deities described in D&amp;D supplements, along with the five alignment components. If a cleric worshiping a different deity casts this spell, the DM should assign an appropriate weapon special ability of the same power level as those given here.</p>

      <p>Wind whips into a frenzy and becomes a tornado that wreaks destruction as you direct, flinging your foes into the air and destroying nearby structures.</p>
      <p>This spell is a more potent version of whirlwind (PH 301). A greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.</p>
      <p>Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4×10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.</p>
      <p>Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.</p>
      <p>Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a</p>
      <p>Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6×10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6×5 feet toward the twister’s center.</p>
      <p>Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds.</p>
      <p>Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later.</p>
      <p>Inside the Tornado: Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can’t do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a greater whirlwind. When the greater whirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6×5 feet away from the twister’s center in a random direction, and 4d6×5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can’t fly).</p>
      <p>Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (DMG 90) wherever it goes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6×10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.</p>
      <p>No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind.</p>
      <p>A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round.</p>

      <p>After making a dramatic gesture and uttering a few words of power, you close your eyes and open them again, revealing all that is hidden.</p>
      <p>All creatures and objects within a zone of revelation are made visible. This includes invisible creatures, as well as those on coexistent planes such as the</p>
      <p>Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow (DMG 150). Natives of these planes do not lose any abilities but are simply made visible.</p>
      <p>Zone of revelation suppresses but does not dispel invisibility, etherealness, or other spells. Once a formerly invisible object or creature leaves the area, it becomes invisible again. Ethereal creatures in the spell’s area become nonethereal until they move beyond the spell’s range.</p>
      <p>Arcane Material Component: A hand ful of dust from the grave clothes of an undead creature.</p>
