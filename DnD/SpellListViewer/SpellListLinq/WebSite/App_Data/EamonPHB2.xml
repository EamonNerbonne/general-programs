        An affected creature attacks with whatever weapon is in its hand, or with natural weapons.

      </p>
      <p>
        This spell creates the illusion of a fierce battle.  Your enemies move cautiously and pass up the opportunity to strike their foes,
        since the roar and confusion of the battle distracts them.
      </p>
      <p>
        All creatures within the area of the spell that fail their saving throws cannot make attacks of opportunity. In addition, all creatures
        withing the area are considered flanked. A creature ignores these effects when it leaves the spell's area. If a creature reenters the spell's area after leaving it, the creature
        can attempt another save to resist the spell if its initial save failed. A creature that enters the area for the first time after the spell is cast must also make a saving throw to resist
        the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <i>phantom battle</i> spell produces noise appropriate to a mob of creatures locked in battle. Anyone in the battle can plainly see that the conjured fighters are no threat,
        since they          strike solely at other phantom warriors, but the din, tumult, and confusion make it difficult to focus on the true foes at hand. A creature that succeeds
        on its save can still see the spectral outline of the illusion, but is able to block out the distraction and fight as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you cast this spell, you can choose for it not to affect a number of allies you designate less than or equal to your caster level.
