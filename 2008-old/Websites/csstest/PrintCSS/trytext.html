<p>Such a construction is called a compound term.</p><br/>
<p>The above informal discussion based
on examples of simple declarative sentences gives motivation for
introducing basic constructs of the language of symbolic logic. The
kind of logic used here is called <em>predicate
logic</em>. Next a formal definition of this language is given. For
the moment we specify only the form of allowed sentences, while the
meaning of the language will be discussed separately. Thus the
definition covers only the <em>syntax</em>
of the language separated from its <em>semantics</em>.
</p>
<p>From the syntactic point of view
logic formulas are finite sequences of symbols such as variables,
functors and predicate symbols. There are infinitely many of them and
therefore the symbols are usually represented by finite strings of
primitive characters. The representation employed in this book
usually conforms to that specified in the ISO standard of the
programming language Prolog (1995). Thus, the <em>alphabet</em> of the language of
predicate logic consists of the following classes of symbols:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>variables</em> which will be
written as alphanumeric identifiers beginning with capital letters
(sometimes subscriped). Examples of variables are <em>X</em>, <em>X<sub>s</sub></em>,
    <em>Y</em>, <em>X</em><sub>7</sub>,
...;</li>
  <li><em>constants</em> which are
numerals or alphanumeric identifiers beginning with lowercase letters.
Examples of constants are <em>x</em>, <em>alf</em>, <em>none</em>, 17, ...;</li>
  <li><em>functors</em> which are
alphanumeric identifiers beginning with lower-case letters and with an
associated arity &gt; 0. To emphasize the arity <em>n</em> of a functor <em>f</em> it is sometimes written in the
form <em>f / n</em>;</li>
  <li><em>predicate symbols</em> which
are usually alphanumeric identifiers starting with lowercase letters
and with an associated arity &gte; 0. The notation <em>p / n</em> is used also for predicate
symbols;</li>
  <li><em>logical connectives</em>
which are ^ (conjunction), &not; (negation), * (logical equivalence), *
(implication) and * (disjunction);</li>
  <li><em>quantifiers</em> - *
(universal) and * (existential);</li>
  <li><em>auxiliary</em> symbols like
parentheses and commas.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>No syntactic distinction will be
imposed between constants, functors and predicate symbols. However, as
a notational convention we use <em>a</em>,
<em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, ... (with or without adornments)
to denote constants and <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>, ...
to denote variables. Functors are denoted <em>f</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, ... and <em>p</em>,
 <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>, ... are used to denote predicate
symbols. Constants are sometimes viewed as nullary functors. Notice
also that the sets of functors and predicate symbols may contain
identical identifiers with different arities.
</p>
<p>Sentences of natural language consist
of words where objects of the described world are represented by nouns.
In the formalized language of predicate logic objects will be
represented by strings called <em>terms</em>
whose syntax is defined as follows:
