   <p>The above informal discussion based on examples of simple declarative 
    sentences gives motivation for introducing basic constructs of the language of 
    symbolic logic. The kind of logic used here is called <em>predicate logic</em>. 
    Next a formal definition of this language is given. For the moment we specify 
    only the form of allowed sentences, while the meaning of the language will be 
    discussed separately. Thus the definition covers only the <em>syntax</em> of 
    the language separated from its <em>semantics</em>.
   </p>
   <p>From the syntactic point of view logic formulas are finite sequences of 
    symbols such as variables, functors and predicate symbols. There are infinitely 
    many of them and therefore the symbols are usually represented by finite 
    strings of primitive characters. The representation employed in this book 
    usually conforms to that specified in the ISO standard of the programming 
    language Prolog (1995). Thus, the <em>alphabet</em> of the language of 
    predicate logic consists of the following classes of symbols:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>
     <em>variables</em> which will be written as alphanumeric identifiers beginning 
     with capital letters (sometimes subscriped). Examples of variables are <em>X</em>,
     <em>X<sub>s</sub></em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>X</em><sub>7</sub>, ...;</li>
    <li>
     <em>constants</em> which are numerals or alphanumeric identifiers beginning 
     with lowercase letters. Examples of constants are <em>x</em>, <em>alf</em>, <em>none</em>, 
     17, ...;</li>
    <li>
     <em>functors</em> which are alphanumeric identifiers beginning with lower-case 
     letters and with an associated arity &gt; 0. To emphasize the arity <em>n</em> of 
     a functor <em>f</em> it is sometimes written in the form <em>f / n</em>;</li>
    <li>
     <em>predicate symbols</em> which are usually alphanumeric identifiers starting 
     with lowercase letters and with an associated arity &gte; 0. The notation <em>p 
      / n</em> is used also for predicate symbols;</li>
    <li>
     <em>logical connectives</em> which are ^ (conjunction), &not; (negation), * 
     (logical equivalence), * (implication) and * (disjunction);</li>
    <li>
     <em>quantifiers</em> - * (universal) and * (existential);</li>
    <li>
     <em>auxiliary</em> symbols like parentheses and commas.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>No syntactic distinction will be imposed between constants, functors and 
    predicate symbols. However, as a notational convention we use <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>,
    <em>c</em>, ... (with or without adornments) to denote constants and <em>X</em>,
    <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>, ... to denote variables. Functors are denoted <em>f</em>,
    <em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, ... and <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>, ... are 
    used to denote predicate symbols. Constants are sometimes viewed as nullary 
    functors. Notice also that the sets of functors and predicate symbols may 
    contain identical identifiers with different arities.
   </p>
   <p>Sentences of natural language consist of words where objects of the described 
    world are represented by nouns. In the formalized language of predicate logic 
    objects will be represented by strings called <em>terms</em> whose syntax is 
    defined as follows:
